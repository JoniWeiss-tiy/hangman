Week 2 JS project - Create game of Hangman.

You know the word-guessing game hangman? Well that's what you'll be building with this assignment.

Basically, it works like this:

* The app starts by choosing a random word
* The player can guess a single letter at a time
* The player has a fixed number of turns in which to guess all of the letters in the word
* The app should indicate when the player has won or lost
